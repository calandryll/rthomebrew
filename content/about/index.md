In December 2015, my now wife, purchased a Northern Brewer starter kit.  She had heard me mention brewing beer in my younger years, little did she know the rabbit hole it would lead down.  My first beer was brewed in January of 2016, thus establishing the Redtide Home Brewery.  My background is [molecular ecology, with a focus on harmful algal blooms (HAB)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V42cB8IAAAAJ&hl=en).  The name Redtide, comes my background in HAB research, and since it was a unique name, it stuck.

Since January 2016, I have upgraded to a [Brau Supply brew in a basket/bag (BIAB) 120V system](https://brausupply.com/).  Currently, I am upgrading this system to a more automated version using a Raspberry Pi, with an output of 240V.  Also, in progress is a basement brewery.
